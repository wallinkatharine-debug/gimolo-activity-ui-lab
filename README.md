# Gimolo Activity Card Mockups (Static)

This is a **static** (no-build) prototype intended for **GitHub Pages**.

## Files
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `activities.json`

## How to use on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (or use an existing one).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
4. Open the Pages URL.

## Notes
- There are 4 activity card variants (Variant 1–4) designed to keep the **activity** as the hero.
- Uses `activities.json` so you can scale to hundreds of activities without changing UI code.
- Countdown can be toggled in `app.js` (`countdownEnabled`).
